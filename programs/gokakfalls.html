 in India, the Forbes Gokak Spinning Mill (now owned by Gokak Textiles Limited of the Shapoorji
 Pallonji Group) was set up in 1887 in Gokak Falls which is located about 6 km north-west of
 Gokak. It was modernised over decades and is functional till date being a major source of
 economy for the city. A hydroelectric power plant was also set up in Gokak Falls in 1907, is
 one of the oldest projects of a kind in the region.
Gokak taluka contributed to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund which was meant for humanitarian
 assistance for the Indian Ocean tsunami victims. Child Development Project Officer Mr P N Patil
 who addressed a press conference had disclosed that it was decided to donate a day’s salary of
 government officials towards the relief fund. The employees of Forbes-Gokak textile industry

 built in the later Chalukyan style of architecture. The temple has a garbhagriha, (sanctum),
 an ardhamantapa and a spacious but open mukhamantapa (frontal courtyard). The sanctum with
 its tall Shikara adorned with exquisite sculptures is a sight to behold. It faces north, an
 unusual orientation for Shiva temples. On the sides of the Ghataprabha River there are several
 temples apart from Mahalingeshwara temple that date back to the period of the later Chalukyas
 of Kalyana who ruled portions of the Deccan from the 10th to the 12th centuries.
